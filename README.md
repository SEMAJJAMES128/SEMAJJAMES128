I am very passionate about cybersecurity and thrive on solving complex challenges through hands-on projects. Whether it's vulnerability management, threat detection, or incident response, I love diving into the ever-evolving world of cybersecurity and sharpening my skills. These projects have been a great way for me to apply what I’ve learned and explore real-world security operations. Feel free to check them out—I’d love to share the work I’ve put into enhancing security processes and staying ahead of threats!
